2,i have looked at group counseling but they are still remote. i am tired of remote and don't want it simple because it's remote. if it were in person i would definitely go to group therapy.,dissatisfied,dissatisfied

15,"i would not describe any of it as working well. tedium and bureaucracy abound. six complementary sessions with a provider per academic year isn't enough. general poor communication/knowledge of what's available. met with a case manager once who quit or retired (unclear which) before a second meeting so i had to do the bulk of the intake stuff again. that case manager referred me to services that a therapist providing services through caps didn't know about. all this said, it's not clear to me if these problems are unique to my college, because as best i can tell nobody working in mental health has a good picture of the field.

50,"an aspect of mental health that needs improvement is that mentally ill people sometimes aren’t aware that they are unwell, and may not even consider they need help. others that are aware are presented with hindrance stressors, like jumping through a bunch of hoops just to schedule an appointment. it was through a conversation with my advisor (which took me weeks to meet with because i was avoidant) to get an appointment scheduled with someone at sas. i thought they were my counselor, but they only sent me resources to contact a counselor. which is better than nothing. i do not want to complain. 

i do plan on meeting with a counselor because i’m willing to do whatever at this point to get out of this point of my life, however i don’t feel like making an appointment. i haven’t been able to complete my coursework; why would i prioritize scheduling appointments with counselors? 

so i feel as if the campus community could benefit from easy access to a counselor. i think every human being needs to attend counseling, anyways. the challenge would be to make it not too easy to schedule, otherwise it might be overused, and inefficient. ",dissatisfied,mixed

80,cu’s mental health “department” is a shit show. they don’t care about students. they made a promise to bring on 20 new providers and actually fired 10 existing ones instead. when i reached my lowest low i asked for therapy twice a week instead of once and they discontinued my care entirely because of the request. the director did a coverup job and tried to conceal my health records that i am legally obligated to. it took two months for me to finally have all of my health documents in my possession and i had to use a third party to force her to give me the information i was entitled to. ,dissatisfied,dissatisfied

my visits to caps in fall 2019 were practically useless although i was on the brink of a mental health disaster in my life. thankfully, i fixed my problems with the help of friends, family, and even strangers over the semester i took off in fall 2020. this was only because those people truly understood my non-generic problems and were willing to give me time. they were willing to walk alongside me with my every day activities.

maybe matching students who can help each other and both can actually give time of the day to each other might be also a good solution.

1.  **positive/satisfied:** ""we had two days for drop-in counseling... this helped me learn about some resources for myself."" this is a clear expression of satisfaction with a specific service.
2.  **dissatisfaction/suggestions for improvement:** ""i have heard from other students that there can be long wait times to meet with counselors and they're more a short-term solution (e.g., referring students to other therapists)."" these are specific criticisms and suggestions for enhancement, even if based on others' experiences.
3.  **neutral/positive outlook:** ""there is a new telehealth counseling service which i don't know much about but it seems to address these problems."" while not direct satisfaction with a currently working service, this statement acknowledges a new service that is perceived as a positive step to address the previously mentioned issues. it balances the prior negative feedback.

when weighing these points:
*   there's a clear positive statement about drop-in counseling.
*   there are two distinct negative points/suggestions for improvement (wait times, short-term solutions).
*   there's a forward-looking, slightly positive statement about a new service that *seems* to address the problems, acting as a counterweight to the negative points.

considering the positive personal experience, the identified areas for improvement, and the acknowledgement of a potential solution, the overall sentiment is a mix of satisfaction and dissatisfaction/suggestions that are approximately evenly split. the positive outlook on the telehealth service prevents it from being predominantly dissatisfied.

therefore, the most appropriate category is mixed.
